GitHub Pull Request Rejection Bot</h1>
<p>Some projects on GitHub don't accept GitHub Pull Requests. Maybe they have their own contribution processes. Maybe they hate freedom. Either way, GitHub doesn't provide a way to disable pull requests officially.</p>

<p>So I wrote this.</p>

<p>Using this tool, you can effectively <b>disable pull requests</b> for your repo on GitHub. When pull requests are disabled, any time a new one is opened it will immediately be closed by the bot.

<h3>Sound fun?
